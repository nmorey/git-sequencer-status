git-sequencer-status(1)
=======================

NAME
----
git-sequencer-status - Display the status of the git sequencer


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git sequencer-status'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

'git-sequencer-status' displays the status of the git sequencer during
rebase, reverts, am and cherry-picks.

When multiple actions are required, git keeps an internal state of what
is done and what is left to do. git-sequencer-status will display this
state in a human readable format.

This is largely inspired by the way Magit prints its status screen.

OPTIONS
-------

--[no]-color::
		Force coloring to be on/off whether the command is run in a TTY or not

--help::
		Display usage

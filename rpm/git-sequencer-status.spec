%description
Several git commands (rebase, cherry-pick, am, revert) use the git sequencer
 when a list actions needs to be executed.
Althouth all the information is available in the git directory, it can be sometimes quite hard
 to find out where you are within your rebase.

This script prints a status of what was done and what is left to do.

It is largely inspired by what Magit prints in it status screen.
